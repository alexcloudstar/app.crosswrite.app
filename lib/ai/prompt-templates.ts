  This image must look like a real photograph, not a conceptual illustration.

  ðŸ”‘ STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. **Scene** â†’ Always depict ONE clear, realistic environment:
     - A modern desk with a laptop or monitor
     - A plain whiteboard with markers
     - Or a single browser window visible on a screen
  2. **Main Subject** â†’ The subject must directly match the article topic:
     - Code editors (VSCode, JetBrains, etc.) if about coding
     - Browser window if about CSS, frontend, or layouts
     - Postman app if about API testing
     - ER diagram, SQL editor, or dbdiagram.io if about databases
     - Terminal window if about Docker or Git
     - Design tools (Figma, Sketch) if about UX/UI
  3. **Clarity** â†’ The focus should be instantly recognizable from the thumbnail alone.
     Use the content preview above to decide the most fitting subject.
  4. **Fallback Rule** â†’ If unsure, always show a laptop on a clean desk with the relevant app or code editor open.

  ðŸš« DO NOT INCLUDE:
  - Floating icons, cubes, gears, holograms, or abstract shapes
  - Futuristic dashboards, multi-screen walls, or sci-fi control centers
  - Random diagrams, filler charts, or background posters unrelated to the topic
  - Decorative or symbolic overlays (planets, glowing lines, etc.)
  - Generic "techy stock photo" vibes

  âœ… EXAMPLES OF GOOD OUTPUT:
  - "Building a React App" â†’ Laptop on a wooden desk with VSCode open, React code visible, React logo sticker
  - "CSS Grid Layout" â†’ Monitor showing browser window with webpage + visible CSS gridlines
  - "API Testing with Postman" â†’ Postman app on desktop screen showing request/response
  - "Database Design" â†’ Whiteboard with ER diagram drawn in markers OR dbdiagram.io interface on screen
  - "Debugging JavaScript" â†’ Chrome DevTools open with console logs
  - "Docker for Beginners" â†’ Terminal window with Docker commands, Docker whale sticker on laptop
  - "Version Control with Git" â†’ Terminal with git commit / git push commands visible
  - "UX Wireframing" â†’ Figma UI open on screen, with wireframe sketches on nearby notepad

  ðŸŽ¨ STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
  - Photorealistic and natural-looking
  - Natural daylight or warm desk lighting
  - Clean, minimal, modern setup
  - High contrast, sharp details, realistic shadows
  - Professional blog header aesthetic
  - Clear focal point, uncluttered composition

  ðŸ“Œ FINAL RULE:
  The thumbnail must look exactly like a real photo of a workspace or tool in use.
  It must directly illustrate the articleâ€™s subject, with no abstract, symbolic, or decorative elements.
  If in doubt, fall back to: a laptop on a desk with the relevant app or editor open.`;
